# Cooling system for microtome machine
This project seeks to develop and manufacture a device capable of freezing biological samples on the stage of a microtome.
Making sections of biological samples a few microns thick for subsequent histological processing can be achieved using different cutting systems, mainly cryostats, vibratomes and microtomes. The latter are the most commonly used in pathology laboratories. To achieve the necessary resistance for cutting, biological samples must be embedded in support materials (traditionally paraffin), a laborious procedure that requires several hours of work and that in many cases alters the ability to stain the samples. An efficient and fast alternative is freezing the sample on the microtome cutting stage. This technique, cutting using a freezing microtome, is widely used in neuroscience research and other related fields, as well as commonly used in the processing of intrasurgical samples (for example to determine the malignancy of a tumor during exploratory surgery).
The systems available to freeze samples on the microtome are inefficient and require consumables that are difficult to store (dry ice, CO2 tubes). This project seeks to develop and manufacture a device capable of freezing biological samples in a few minutes directly on the cutting stage of a microtome using a thermoelectric module more commonly called a Peltier cell.
